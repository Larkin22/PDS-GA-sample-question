# Here is an example exercise you should be able to do before taking this class: 
# Write a function that prints all of the numbers between 1 and 10,000 that are 
# either divisible by 7 or 33 but not both.

x=[]
for i in range(1, 10001):
    if (i % 7 == 0 and i % 33 == 0):
        continue
    elif (i % 7 == 0): 
        x.append(str(i))
    elif (i % 33 == 0):
        x.append(str(i))
    
print ','.join(x)

print len(x)
